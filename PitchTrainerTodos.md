# Todo list for PitchTrainer #

Near future:

  * Get it working on a Harmattan device :-)
  * Handle screen rotation
  * Make user interface predominantly black for power usage friendliness.
  * Add more excercises. Currently only melodic intervals are supported. Harmonic intervals should be added.
  * Add other instruments to UX. Let the user give the notes on a (say) keyboard and perhaps other instruments.

Slightly less near future:

  * Melodic intervals from specific scale - like the pentatonic blues scale
  * Statistics. Some way of tracking ones progress (or lack thereof).

Not near future
  * Make it possible to give the answer on a real guitar, with PitchTrainer picking up the note via audio-input.
  * Add utilities for guitarplayer like a tuner or a metronome.
