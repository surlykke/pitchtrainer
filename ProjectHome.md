# Pitch trainer #

Pitch trainer is an application to use for training relative pitch: The application plays (via midi) an interval and the user will try to identify the interval played.
The application is primarily aimed at guitarplayers, as the interval will be played with a guitar sound, and the user guesses the interval by clicking/touching on a guitar fretboard.

Later versions may suppport other instruments.

The application is developed in c++/Qt and it is intended that it should run on desktop/Maemo/Meego/Symbian
